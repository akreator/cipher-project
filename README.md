Cipher Project - Senior Year, 2015
----------------------------------
This is a project I designed and created to help users encode and decode historical ciphers.
The TextTools package can be used on its own to encode/decode/format any text - it accepts and returns strings, for the most part - but the overall project has a GUI, based out of the CipherGui package.  Which you should check out.  Because I spent a lot of time on that.

*** CURRENT CIPHERS ***
 - Caesar (ROT13)
 - Substitution (Atbash and A1Z26 programmed in)
 - Vignere
 - Pig Latin
 - Box (Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal transposition)

*** IN-PROGRESS CIPHERS ***
 - Morse code
 - Binary

*** PLANNED CIPHERS ***
 - Enigma Machine Simulator
 - (maybe) Homophonic substiution cipher

Installation
------------
All you need is Java.  If you don't have Java, download it from: https://www.java.com/en/download/
To use the cipher project, download the project and navigate to the "dist" folder.  Then, run the jar file found there.  
You may recieve a security warning, but the program is safe as far as I know.  You can check out the code, yourself.

FAQ
---
Q: What class did you do this for?
A: None.  I coded this on my own, for fun.

Q: But doesn't that make you a ... nerd!?
A: Yes.

Q: I know this really cool cipher that you should include in the Cipher Project!
A: That's awesome!  E-mail me and we can talk.

Q: Are you ever going to make an app?
A: I hope so.  Since I'm doing an independent study in web development next semester, I'm going to make a website for the Cipher Project first.  I'll start working on an app this summer.
