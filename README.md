Cipher Project - Senior Year, 2015-2016
---------------------------------------
This is a project I designed and created to help users encode and decode historical ciphers.
The texttools package can be used on its own to encode/decode/format any text -- it accepts and returns strings, for the most part -- but the overall project has a GUI, based out of the ciphergui package.  Which you should check out.  Because I spent a lot of time on that.

*** CURRENT CIPHERS ***
 - Caesar (ROT13)
 - Substitution (Atbash and A1Z26 programmed in)
 - Vigenere
 - Pig Latin
 - Box (Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal transposition)
 - Binary Code

*** IN-PROGRESS CIPHERS ***
 - Morse code

*** PLANNED CIPHERS ***
 - Enigma Machine Simulator
 - (maybe) Homophonic substiution cipher
 - Hex Code

Installation/Use
----------------
All you need is Java.  If you don't have Java, download it from: https://www.java.com/en/download/
To use the cipher project, download the project and navigate to the "dist" folder.  Then, run the jar file found there.  
You may recieve a security warning, but the program is safe as far as I know.  You can check out the code, yourself.

FAQ
--- 
Q: What class did you do this for? <br/>
A: None.  I coded this on my own, for fun.

Q: But doesn't that make you a ... nerd!? <br/>
A: Yes.

Q: I know this really cool cipher that you should include in the Cipher Project! <br/>
A: That's awesome!  E-mail me and we can talk.

Q: Are you ever going to make an app? <br/>
A: I hope so.  Since I'm doing an independent study in web development next semester, though, I'm going to make a website for the Cipher Project first.  I'll start working on an app this summer.

Q: When did you start the Cipher Project? <br/>
A: Mid-September, 2015.  I started using GitHub after the project was well on its way, so its earlier stages aren't available online.

Q: Why did you refactor EVERYTHING? <br/>
A: I don't know a lot about about coding style.  But, when I learn something new, I try to implement it to make my code easier to understand in the long run.  Unfortunately, this means that the project's structure changes every so often.
