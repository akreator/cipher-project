Cipher Project - Senior Year, 2015
----------------------------------
This is a project I designed to help users encode and decode simple historical ciphers.
The Text class can be used on its own to encode and decode any text, but the overall 
project has a GUI.  Which you should check out.  Because I spent a lot of time on that.

*** CURRENT CIPHERS ***
Caesar (ROT13)
Substitution (Atbash)
Vignere
Pig Latin

*** IN-PROGRESS CIPHERS ***
N/A

*** PLANNED CIPHERS ***
Morse code; Binary; 
(maybe) Homophonic substiution cipher


Installation
------------
All you need is Java.  If you don't have Java, download it from: https://www.java.com/en/download/
To use the cipher project, download the project, and then navigate to the "dist" folder.  
Then, run the jar file found there.
